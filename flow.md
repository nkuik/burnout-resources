# Flow

[Mihaly CsÃ­kszentmihÃ¡lyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) is the preeminent researcher on flow. He started by studying musicians and artists to better understand the shared mechanics  
the state that these individuals share.

## Six Components

CsÃ­kszentmihÃ¡lyi has identified six major components that are present in a  
flow state:

1. An intense focus and concentration on the task at hand. â€¨
2. A merging of action and awareness in that the activity becomes spontaneous and automatic. â€¨
3. A sense of control over what one is doing. â€¨
4. A loss of self-consciousness and a lack of concern for or about oneself. â€¨
5. A transformation of oneâ€™s perception of time passing. â€¨
6. A sense of enjoyment in the intrinsic motivation of the activity.

## How to Flow

All you need to do to get into a flow state is...

Of course there is no single method to move into flow. It is one of those things that the more you reach for it, the further it moves away. However, there are a few things that you might do to increase the chance of a flow state, many having to do with attention and focus:

* Do things you like
* Limit distractions (don't use social media while doing it)
* Avoid context switching or things that lead you down unrelated rabbit holes
* Get really good at something (intentional practice)
* Don't think too much ðŸ˜‰
* Take a look at the [mindfulness tips](mindfulness.md)
