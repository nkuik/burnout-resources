# Facilitating Flow States at Work

Having a definition for flow is useful, but how does one actually facilitate its presence at work? There is no algorithm or manual to suddenly enter flow--as far as we know this isn't the Matrix. However, here is an example of mapping the characteristics of flow to a model of important work.

## [Job Characteristics Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_characteristic_theory) (JCM)

Identifies five characteristics that help induce Critical Psychological States (CPS). These five areas are:

1. Skill variety
2. Task identity
3. Task significance
4. Autonomy
5. Feedback

Questions to ask yourself:

* Do I get to work on a variety of tasks?
* How segmented is the work? Is it broken into reasonable chunks?
* Is the task something I care about?
* Can I make my own decisions about the way I do the work?
* What kind of feedback do I get about the way I'm performing the task?

Depending on what you answered, the next task is to break down your answers and determine what actions to take.
