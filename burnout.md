# Burnout

There are three main characteristics of burnout, as conceptualize by the
[Maslach Burnout Inventory](https://www.mindgarden.com/117-maslach-burnout-inventory) (paywall):

1. High degrees of exhaustion
2. Cynicism or depersonalization (not feeling connected to work)
3. Low feelings of professional efficacy

Some questions that are good to ask yourself if you have a sense that you
might be experiencing burnout:

* Do I have energy for anything besides work?
* Do I _want_ to do anything other than work?
* Am I using the appearance as the super busy, all-important workaholic as an excuse to work more?
* What kind (if any) negative energy do I have towards the work that I'm doing?
* Does it feel like I'm making any sort of contribution in my work?
* Do I put importance on the feeling of my work making a difference?

## Risk Factors (Maslach Inventory)

There are several categories in a person's life that can contribute to burnout, varying from personal psychology, managerial procedures,
and workplace culture.

1. Mismatch in workload
2. Mismatch in control
3. Lack of appropriate awards
4. Loss of a sense of positive connection with others in the workplace
5. Perceived lack of fairness
6. Conflict between values

As you can see, these include both structural and internal factors, so determining if you're "burntout" can be highly subjective. I think it's
best to reserve the term for more serious cases, as some people use it
when they are simply sick of something.

## Clustered Symptoms ([Kaschka, Korczak, Broich, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22163259))

* Compulsion to prove oneself
* Feeling no upper limit to the vigor of which one works 
* Neglecting personal needs
* Displacement of conflicts and needs
* No time for non-work related hobbies/responsibilities
* Increasing denial of a problem and a decreasing flexibility of thought and behaviour
* Inner emptiness, anxiety, addictive behaviour
* Feelings of meaningless and lack of interest
* Physical exhaustion
