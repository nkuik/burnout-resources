# Behavior Change

What is often missing within health and wellness tips are ways that people can actually change habits, so I've added some things to help think about how one approaches modifying habits.

## [Stages of Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transtheoretical_model)

The stages of change model emerged from the research by Prochaska and Di Clemente around the 1980s when they were researching the process by which humans attempt to adopt healthier habits or terminate unhealthy habits.

In this model there are five main stages:

1. Precontemplation
2. Contemplation
3. Preparation
4. Action
5. Maintenance

It can also be helpful to see all the stages in a graphical representation such as [this](http://workoutnirvana.com/six-steps-of-behavioral-change/).

The most important idea within this model is that we are always passing between stages and that ambivalence is the norm, so it is absolutely fine if we feel a bit conflicted about making the change ("on the one hand I want to reduce distractions, but I'm also worried about missing out on my friends social media posts").

This gives us the freedom to pass off our lack of motivation and somewhat fickle attitudes that accompany behavior change. So we no longer need to judge ourselves when we don't feel like doing something or have an urge repeat an old behavior. Instead we can focus our attention on the things we need to do to make changes.

## [Relapse Prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse_prevention)

Also originally developed for use within the substance use disorder field, relapse prevention is also another helpful way to think about changing behaviors. While relapse might sound a bit serious, it does represent our movement back into old patterns of behavior after we've changed them.

Relapse prevention can be summarized in this way: increasing internal resources within an individual to help in the moments where the risk of relapse is high.

[Mindfulness based relapse prevention](http://www.mindfulrp.com/) has some practical ways to improve one's relationship with potential relapse, the most prominent of which is "urge surfing". The idea behind this is being able to rely on mindfulness techniques when one experiences urges. The reality is that if we have some resources to deal with urges, they will dissipate and decrease over time.

Some helpful practices one can do when one feels an urge to move back into old behavior patterns are:

* Setting a specific time limit for when you will watch and notice the urge without giving into it
* Doing a mindfulness, meditation, or yoga exercise when one notices an urge
* Rate the strength of the urge
* Write down some thoughts that accompany the urge ("I think I'll be happier if I eat that whole bag of chips", etc.)
