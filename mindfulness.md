# Mindfulness

Mindfulness is also without a formula or algorithm. Basically the only way 
to do mindfulness "wrong" is not to practice it. This makes intentional 
essential. To that end...

## Intentional Practice

* [Body Scan](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/body_scan_meditation)
* Sitting meditation
* [Walking meditation](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/walking_meditation)
* Mindfully doing anything
* Yoga
* Laughing
* Choosing a marker (walking through the door, putting on your shoes, brushing your teeth, etc.) as a time to return to mindfulness
* Anything else from Berkeley's [Greater Good in Action](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/) site

## Limiting Distractions

* [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) or other activity trackers (*remember potential privacy concerns)
* [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

## Tools

Is an app really the best way to become more mindful? I'm not necessarily against it, as we must all find what works for us, but simpler is always better for me.

* A clock
